Welcome to my first GitHub Repository.  

This is where I am storing all of my coursework material for my bootcamp as well as my projects that I create to test my skills.

In order to be navigate this, let me explain how to understand the folders:

#1 The majority of my projects will be in folder 1-HTML-CSS-Javascript.  In this folder, all my projects are in self-identified folders with their necessary html, css, and js files.  

#2 The remaining folders are still being populated as I continue to learn and grow in both front-end and back-end.
